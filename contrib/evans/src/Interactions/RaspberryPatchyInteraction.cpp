// Name is temporary (aka, we're going to keep saying we should get around to renaming it, then not do that)
// code will be pilfered (sorry, "adapted") from both romano/src/Interactions/PatchyShapeInteraction (on oxDNA_torsion repo)
// and a little from Lorenzo Rovigatti's interactions
//

#include "RaspberryPatchyInteraction.h"
